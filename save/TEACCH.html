        Treatment and Education of Autistic and Communication Handicapped
        Children (TEACCH)
      </h2>
      <h4><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i> History</h4>
      <p>
        During the 1960s, Eric Schopler argued that Autism Spectrum Disorders
        (ASD) were probably the result of an organic neurological dysfunction,
        although the precise causes were not yet identified. He adopts a new
        approach in which parents are trained as co-therapists of their child
        (Tréhin & Durham, 1996). The preliminary results of this approach led
        the state of North Carolina to commit to helping people with ASD by
        setting up a program called "Treatment and Education of Autistic and
        Communication handicapped Children" (TEACCH) created by Eric Schopler.
        This type of program then spread to other US states and gained
        popularity around the world (Peerenboom, 2003).
      </p>
      <h4><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i> Description</h4>
      <p>
        The TEACCH program is based on structured teaching and applied behavior
        analysis, with the core principle of organizing the learning environment
        to promote the acquisition of new skills. According to Mesibov and Shea
        (2010), the four essential mechanisms of the TEACCH are:
      </p>
      <ul class="list_ul">
        <li>
          structuring the environment and activities in ways that are
          understandable to the individual
        </li>
        <li>
          using individuals’ relative strengths in visual skills and interest in
          visual details to supplement relatively weaker skills
        </li>
        <li>using individuals’ special interests to engage them in learning</li>
        <li>supporting self-initiated use of meaningful communication.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Structuring the environment - in both space and time - is achieved
        through:
      </p>
      <ul class="list_ul">
        <li>
          providing a physical structuration, for example by using clear and
          concrete visual information (words, pictures, photos, or concrete
          objects)
        </li>
        <li>
          organizing and communicating the sequence of events of the day, by
          creating schedules adapted to the person
        </li>
        <li>
          organizing individual activities, to facilitate, for example, the
          understanding of what is expected of the person during the activity,
          the time it will take or the signal that will indicate that the
          activity is finished
        </li>
        <li>
          linking all the activities together into a sequence of activities
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Once a skill has been established, patients or caregivers are then
        taught to use that behavior in a less structured and less
        "accommodating" environment. Generalization of skills and abilities is
        then achieved by repeating, in new contexts, the exercises performed
        with professionals. Note that this program is often implanted in
        classrooms but it has also been used at home or in the community.
      </p>

      <p>
        The long-term goal of the TEACCH program is to promote optimal
        functioning to facilitate integration into society. Unlike other more
        specific programs, the TEACCH program offers a continuum of services to
        patients, their families, and practitioners across the lifespan.
      </p>
      <h4><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i> In the database</h4>
      <p>
        Despite the potential lifelong application of the TEACCH program and the
        appropriateness of this program to different developmental levels, the
        meta-analyses included in the database assessed the efficacy of this
        program mostly among very young children with important cognitive
        difficulties. The intensity is often moderate (between 5 to 19h a week)
        and the setting could be at home or at school.
