      <h2>Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions (NDBI)</h2>
      <h4><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i> History</h4>
      <p>
        Historically, the applied behavior analysis (ABA) approach has been used
        extensively in the management of individuals with ASD. Progressively, in
        concert with the development of ABA-focused programs (e.g., the Lovaas
        program), numerous models of child development emerged. This leads
        clinicians and researchers working with individuals with ASD to
        introduce aspects of these developmental theories to the care of
        children with ASD. For example, it has been thought to use interventions
        based on the principle of ABA interventions but in more naturalistic and
        developmentally sensitive contexts, using rewards linked to the activity
        performed by the child instead of rewards independent of the activity,
        or using materials that the child appreciates. Moreover, professionals
        have began to focus on certain key skills and knowledge that will enable
        the emergence of other skills or knowledge later in the development
        (e.g., a focus can be made in improving joint attention to facilitate
        the future emergence of language). As these interventions have evolved,
        they have increasingly begun to blend developmental theories and
        interventions with ABA, and thus, the NDBI approaches were bor With the
        development of these new, more naturalistic approaches, Schreibman and
        colleagues (2015) have created the term 'Naturalistic Developmental
        Behavioral Interventions' (NDBI) to regroup certain interventions
        integrating the knowledge provided by the developmental theories in
        ABA-focused interventions.

      <h4><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i> Description</h4>
      <p>Schreibman et al. (2015) described 13 core principles of NDBIs</p>
      <ul class="list_ul">
        <li>
          Teaching incorporates the three-part contingency of antecedent,
          behaviour, consequence.
        </li>
        <li>The use of a manual to guide implementation.</li>
        <li>
          Fidelity checks to ensure the intervention is implemented accurately.
        </li>
        <li>Individualised intervention goals.</li>
        <li>Ongoing measurement of progress.</li>
        <li>Child-initiated teaching episodes.</li>
        <li>
          Arranging the environment to promote children’s interaction and
          learning.
        </li>
        <li>
          A focus on intrinsic reinforcement and natural contingencies, over
          external reinforcement.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use of prompting and prompt fading to teach skills, leading to
          children’s independent use.
        </li>
        <li>
          Helping children to learn to take turns in social and play routines.
        </li>
        <li>
          Adults modelling the skills children are being supported to learn.
        </li>
        <li>
          Adults imitating children’s actions and attempts to communicate to
          motivate further communication attempts.
        </li>
        <li>
          Systematic attempts to broaden children’s repertoires of skills and
          interests
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i> In the database</h4>
      <p>
        In this database, two recent meta-analyses explored the efficacy of
        NDBIs in children with ASD. Both focused on clinical trials conducted
        among very young children with important cognitive difficulties. The
        interventions are dispensed at lower intensity (mostly between 5 and 19
        hours per week) and both professionals and parents are used to dispense
        the intervention.
      </p>
      <p>
        One meta-analysis focused on a specific NDBI intervention, Pivotal
        Response Training (PRT).
