      <h2>Parent-mediated interventions (PMI)</h2>
      <h4><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i> History</h4>
      <p>Since the beginning of the development of interventions for children with ASDs, some authors have given parents a privileged position in the intervention process (e.g., Schopler, 1971).
        Parents-mediated interventions (PMI) propose to teach intervention techniques to parents so that they can apply these techniques with their child on a regular basis.
        The objective of involving parents is to implement a first interventions very early in the child's development and, because of the sharing of the daily environment, to improve the generalization of the skills learned by the child during the intervention.
      </p>
    <h4><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i> Description</h4>
    <p>The type of intervention that can be mediated by parents is very wide, ranging from application of massages to an early intensive behavioral intervention.
      Even within PMIs that provide psychosocial interventions, some interventions propose to teach parents to implement social-communication interactions, others to use joint attention or to implement an applied behavioral analysis approach.
      The primary outcome intrinsecally targeted by these interventions can be quite variable, with interventions seeking to improve primarily problem behaviors, communication, or parent-child interactions (Oono et al., 2013)</p>

      <h4><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i> In the database</h4>
        <p>The meta-analyses included in this database reflect this heterogeneity in the approaches used by PMIs.
          However, despite the diversity of approaches used by the different clinical trials included in the meta-analyses evaluating the efficacy of PMIs, there are common points: </p>
          <ul class="list_ul">
            <li>The parent is always the primary implementer of the therapy</li>
            <li>The approach used by the parent is always a psychosocial approach</li>
            <li>Children who receive the PMI are mostly very young</li>
            <li>Naturalistic developmental behavioral interventions (NDBI) and developmental interventions (DEV) are the two most frequently approaches implanted by the parents</li>
          </ul>
