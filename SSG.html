      <h2>Social Skills Groups (SSG)</h2>
      <h4><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i> History</h4>
      <p>
        Since the first description of ASD by Leo Kanner, difficulties with
        social skills have remained a cornerstone of the definition of ASD.
        These difficulties can manifest in very distinct ways for different
        individuals: some individuals with ASD have a desire to interact with
        others but do not know how to connect with friends while some others
        have a desire to avoid social interactions (Chevallier et al., 2012;
        Mazurek, 2014). Regardless of the manifestation of these social skill
        difficulties, poor social skills have been shown to be associated with
        poorer outcomes in daily life (Billstedt et al., 2005; Taylor et al.,
        2015; Mazurek, 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result, interventions for individuals with ASD have historically
        sought to target these social skill difficulties, with the underlying
        assumption that improving social skills will reduce difficulties that
        patients face in their daily lives.

      <h4><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i> Description</h4>
      <p>
        Social skills groups (SSG) are a form of behavioral intervention rooted
        in the learning theory. It is aiming to improve an individualâ€™s social
        functioning by teaching to small groups certain social skills in a
        theory-based format and immediately associating this teaching with the
        practice of the newly learned skill. Typically, SSG sessions begin
        through specific instruction on a social skill, explain how to carry it
        out and model the skill. Then, the group members practice their use of
        the skill (e.g., through role-playing). The presence of several members
        in the group allows individuals with ASD to support each other and to
        have examples, and the presence of several clinicians allows to provide
        an individualized feedback. Repetition, practice, as well as behavioral
        techniques (such as immediate reinforcement) and cognitive strategies
        are used to increase the likelihood that the skill will be used again
        outside the context of the intervention.
      </p>

      <p>A common plan for SSG is:</p>
      <ul class="list_ul">
        <li>
          60 to 90 minutes sessions including both a structured lesson on a
          specific skill and the concrete practice of this skill
        </li>
        <li>one session per week</li>
        <li>for at least 12 weeks</li>
      </ul>

      <h4><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i> In the database</h4>
      <p>
        Meta-analyses of SSG included in the database assessed the efficacy of
        this intervention type in school-age children, adolescents and young
        adults with ASD. Of note, the meta-analysis conducted among adolescents
        assessed specifically the efficacy of the PEERS program. A meta-analysis
        also assessed the efficacy of a SSG dispensed in a brief but very
        intesive summer camp (the SummerMAX program).
