These constructivist theories consider that the learner acquires knowledge on the basis of her or his perceptions of reality and experience: we learn by constructing knowledge and reconstructing our perceptions to adapt them to our own contexts. These constructivist theories thus postulate that learners acquire knowledge not by passively absorbing it, but by actively putting it into perspective with their experiences and representations (Elliott et al., 2000). Therefore, learning is intrinsically relative to a learner's stage of cognitive development.</p></p></div></div><div class='hero_description'><div class='header_tab'>Description of DEV</div><p><p>In this constructivist perspective, several authors emphasize the role of social interactions in the development (e.g., Vygostsky, 1978). In line with this perspective, developmental interventions aim to support children acquire knowledge and skills through interactions with caregivers or professionals. Developmental interventions seek to elicit skills in children with ASD that should be present but have not been spontaneously acquired. The targeted skills are chosen based on the developmental stage of the child. These skills are critical for learning and are generally related to interacting with others (e.g., imitiation skills, joint attention skills, etc...).</p><p>Two core features of the developmental interventions are (Sandbank et al., 2020):<ul><li>the intervention is implemented according to a typical developmental sequence, so that the aim of the interventions matches with the developmental learning stages of the child.</li><li>the intervention is heavily 'child-led' to rely on the child's intrinsic motivation to engage with the adult</ul></li></p></p></div></div></div><hr class="custom-hr"><div class='header_shalf'>What we found in the scientific literature</div><div class='shalf'><div class='shalf_carac'><div class='header_tab'>Key characteristics of DEV</div>The intervention is typically designed for <u>very young children (<6 yo)</u>, with <u>important cognitive difficulties</u>. This type of intervention is delivered at home. It is typically administered by caregiver. Regarding dosage/intensity, we found that Developmental interventions is provided for an average of 6 hour/week (from 1 hour/week to 23 hour/week).
