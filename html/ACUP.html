This practice includes various techniques such as body acupuncture, scalp acupuncture, and electroacupuncture. Treatment protocols are typically customized to individual needs and administered by qualified practitioners.</p><p>The traditional model of acupuncture is based on a holistic approach to human health, aiming to achieve a balance between mind and body (homeostasis). According to this model, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) results from "dysregulation and insufficiency of the brain and mind" (Chen et al., 2008, cited by Cheuk, 2011). Acupuncture is believed to alleviate symptoms by reharmonizing the body and mind. The mechanisms at play may involve the modulation of neurotransmitters, such as glutamate and GABA, which are known to be disrupted in individuals with ASD (Chao 2010, Carlson 2011, cited by Cheuk, 2011).</p><p>The medical acupuncture paradigm hypothesizes that acupoints are connected to sensory neurons. Stimulation of these points triggers a cascade of neurological responses within the central nervous system, influencing the production of endorphins, serotonin, and endocannabinoids, as well as affecting immunological and endocrinological markers.</p></p></div></div></div><hr class="custom-hr"><div class='header_shalf'>What we found in the scientific literature</div><div class='shalf'><div class='shalf_carac'><div class='header_tab'>Key characteristics of ACUP</div>The intervention is typically designed for <u>school-age children (6-12 yo)</u>.
