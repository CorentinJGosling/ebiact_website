Interventions involve structured musical activities such as singing, playing an instrument, improvising, and listening to music. These activities are designed to engage individuals in a motivating and enjoyable way. </p><p>The World Federation of Music Therapy (WFMT) defines music therapy as '<i>the professional use of music and its elements as an intervention in medical, educational, and everyday environments with individuals, groups, families, or communities who seek to optimize their quality of life and improve their physical, social, communicative, emotional, intellectual, and spiritual health and wellbeing.</i>' Music therapy includes various activities, such as:<ul><li><u>Music listening: </u> Passive engagement with music to induce relaxation or evoke emotional responses.</li><li><u>Practice: </u> Active engagement through singing, playing instruments, and rhythm training to enhance motor skills and coordination.</li><li><u>Improvisational music-making:</u> Creating spontaneous music to encourage creativity and expression.<p>In the context of autism, music therapy operates on the premise that music is a universal language that can stimulate communication. It can help individuals with autism by encouraging joint attention, eye contact, and turn-taking, making it accessible to both verbal and non-verbal people. Additionally, musical improvisation provides a structured yet flexible context, offering predictability with room for spontaneity. </ul></li></p></p></div></div></div><hr class="custom-hr"><div class='header_shalf'>What we found in the scientific literature</div><div class='shalf'><div class='shalf_carac'><div class='header_tab'>Key characteristics of MUSIC</div>The intervention is typically designed for different age groups, <u>very young children (<6 yo), school-age children (6-12 yo)</u>, with <u>no specific cognitive difficulties</u>.
