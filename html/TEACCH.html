He adopts a new approach in which parents are trained as co-therapists of their child (Trehin & Durham, 1996). The preliminary results of this approach led the state of North Carolina to commit to helping people with ASD by setting up a program called "Treatment and Education of Autistic and Communication handicapped Children" (TEACCH) created by Eric Schopler. This type of program then spread to other US states and gained popularity around the world (Peerenboom, 2003).</p></div></div><div class='hero_description'><div class='header_tab'>Description of TEACCH</div><p>The TEACCH program is based on structured teaching and applied behavior analysis, with the core principle of organizing the learning environment to promote the acquisition of new skills. According to Mesibov and Shea (2010), the four essential mechanisms of the TEACCH are:</p>
<p><ul>
<li>structuring the environment and activities in ways that are understandable to the individual</li>
<li>using individuals' relative strengths in visual skills and interest in visual details to supplement relatively weaker skills</li>
<li>using individuals' special interests to engage them in learning</li>
<li>supporting self-initiated use of meaningful communication.</li></ul></p>
<p>Structuring the environment - in both space and time - is achieved through:<ul>
<li>providing a physical structuration, for example by using clear and concrete visual information (words, pictures, photos, or concrete objects)</li>
<li>organizing and communicating the sequence of events of the day, by creating schedules adapted to the person</li>
<li>organizing individual activities, to facilitate, for example, the understanding of what is expected of the person during the activity, the time it will take or the signal that will indicate that the activity is finished</li>
<li>linking all the activities together into a sequence of activities</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Once a skill has been established, patients or caregivers are then taught to use that behavior in a less structured and less "accommodating" environment. Generalization of skills and abilities is then achieved by repeating, in new contexts, the exercises performed with professionals. Note that this program is often implanted in classrooms but it has also been used at home or in the community.</p>
<p>The long-term goal of the TEACCH program is to promote optimal functioning to facilitate integration into society. Unlike other more specific programs, the TEACCH program offers a continuum of services to patients, their families, and practitioners across the lifespan.</p></div></div></div><hr class="custom-hr"><div class='header_shalf'>What we found in the scientific literature</div><div class='shalf'><div class='shalf_carac'><div class='header_tab'>Key characteristics of TEACCH</div>The intervention is typically designed for different age groups, <u>very young children (<6 yo) to school-age children (6-12 yo)</u>, but with <u>important cognitive difficulties</u>.
