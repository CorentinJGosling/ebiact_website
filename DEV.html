      <h2>Developmental interventions (DEV)</h2>
      <h4><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i> History</h4>
      <p>
        Developmental interventions are built upon constructivist theories of
        learning (Piaget & Inhelder, 1969). These constructivist theories
        consider that the learner acquires knowledge on the basis of her or his
        perceptions of reality and experience: we learn by constructing
        knowledge and reconstructing our perceptions to adapt them to our own
        contexts. These constructivist theories thus postulate that learners
        acquire knowledge not by passively absorbing it, but by actively putting
        it into perspective with their experiences and representations (Elliott
        et al., 2000). Therefore, learning is intrinsically relative to a
        learnerâ€™s stage of cognitive development.
      </p>
      <h4><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i> Description</h4>
      <p>
        In this constructivist perspective, several authors emphasize the role
        of social interactions in the development (e.g., Vygostsky, 1978). In
        line with this perspective, developmental interventions aim to support
        children acquire knowledge and skills through interactions with
        caregivers or professionals. Developmental interventions seek to elicit
        skills in children with ASD that should be present but have not been
        spontaneously acquired. The targeted skills are chosen based on the
        developmental stage of the child. These skills are critical for learning
        and are generally related to interacting with others (e.g., imitiation
        skills, joint attention skills, etc...).
      </p>
      <p>
        Two core features of the developmental interventions are (Sandbank et
        al., 2020):
      </p>
      <ul class="list_ul">
        <li>
          the intervention is implemented according to a typical developmental
          sequence, so that the aim of the interventions matches with the
          developmental learning stages of the child.
        </li>
        <li>
          the intervention is heavily 'child-led' to rely on the child's
          intrinsic motivation to engage with the adult
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i> In the database</h4>
      <p>
        In the dabatase, two meta-analyses explored the efficacy of overall
        developemental interventions. Thes meta-analyses include clinical trials
        conducted among very young children, for which caregivers are often the
        primary providers of the intervention. One of these meta-analyses
        focused on the 'DIR/Floortime' program, which is a proeminent example of
        developmental interventions.
