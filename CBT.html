      <h2>Cognitive Behvioral Therapy (CBT)</h2>
      <h4><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i> History</h4>
      <p>
        Cognitive Behvioral Therapy (CBT) is a form of interventions positing
        that certain mental disorders and problem behaviours are maintained by
        maladaptive cognitions (Beck, 1970). The basic CBT model posits that
        therapeutic strategies chaging these maladaptive cognitions will lead to
        changes in emotional distress and problematic behaviors. From this basic
        principle, a large number of condition-specific CBT protocols have been
        developed over time, with the treatment of anxiety and depression as the
        most targeted outcomes for this type of intervention (Dragioti et al.,
        2017).
      </p>

      <h4><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i> Description</h4>
      <p>
        Currently, core principles of CBT include (American Psychological
        Association, 2017):
      </p>
      <ul class="list_ul">
        <li>
          Psychological problems are based, in part, on faulty or unhelpful ways
          of thinking.
        </li>
        <li>
          Psychological problems are based, in part, on learned patterns of
          unhelpful behavior.
        </li>
        <li>
          People suffering from psychological problems can learn better ways of
          coping with them, thereby relieving their symptoms and becoming more
          effective in their lives.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        CBT treatment usually involves efforts to change thinking patterns.
        These strategies might include:
      </p>
      <ul class="list_ul">
        <li>
          Learning to recognize one’s distortions in thinking that are creating
          problems, and then to reevaluate them in light of reality.
        </li>
        <li>
          Gaining a better understanding of the behavior and motivation of
          others.
        </li>
        <li>Using problem-solving skills to cope with difficult situations.</li>
        <li>
          Learning to develop a greater sense of confidence in one’s own
          abilities.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        CBT treatment also usually involves efforts to change behavioral
        patterns. These strategies might include::
      </p>
      <ul class="list_ul">
        <li>Facing one’s fears instead of avoiding them.</li>
        <li>
          Using role playing to prepare for potentially problematic interactions
          with others.
        </li>
        <li>Using problem-solving skills to cope with difficult situations.</li>
        <li>Learning to calm one’s mind and relax one’s body.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i> In the database</h4>
      <p>
        In the database, the meta-analyses exploring the efficacy of CBT on
        social-communication include clinical trials conducted among school-age
        children with ASD without major cognitive difficulties. The
        interventions are dispensed by a professional at a low intensity (< 2
        hours per week) and for a relatively short period (during two to six
        months).
