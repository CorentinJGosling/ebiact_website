      <h2>Early Intensive Behavioral Interventions <br />(EIBI)</h2>
      <h4><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i> History</h4>
      <p>
        Early Intensive Behavioral Interventions (EIBI) are behavioral
        interventions that are widely used in the management of individuals with
        ASD. They are based on the Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) model and,
        historically, they have relied on the Lovaas model (1981, 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
        The foundation of the program developed by Ivar Lovaas is that a
        behavioral intervention can build positive behaviors and suppress
        unwanted ones. According to Lovaas, the younger the child, the more
        effective the generalized learning opportunity will be. This program
        uses the principles of operant conditioning: positive behaviors are
        reinforced while negative or aggressive behaviors are ignored
        (historically, these negative behaviours could have been punished using
        aversives but this has been criticized and is no longer used, Dixon et
        al., 2012). The reinforcers are external to the tasks being taught and
        pre-selected by the adult.
      </p>

      <p>
        The main behavioral technique used in the Lovaas program is Discrete
        Trial Training (DTT), which consists of (Doehring, 2001) :
      </p>
      <ul class="list_ul">
        <li>presenting a stimulus in repeated sequences</li>
        <li>then observing the child's response to these presentations</li>
        <li>rewarding expected responses of the child (reinforcement)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Progressively, the therapeutic team makes the tasks more complex. The
        goal of the program is to allow the child to progressively develop
        skills related to autonomy, receptive language, verbal and non-verbal
        imitation and to establish the basis for play. A key aspect of this
        program is teaching the child imitation skills. Once taught, imitation
        is used as a learning tool. As soon as the child has acquired certain
        skills, the goal is to help the child generalize these skills at home
        and then in a school setting.
      </p>

      <h4><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i> Description</h4>
      <p>
        Because many researchers were concerned that the highly-structured and
        adult-led environment proposed in the Lovaas program could result in an
        over-reliance on adults' prompts and limit children's ability to
        generalize learned skills to news contexts, both researchers and
        clinicians have worked to improve and expand the Lovaas program
        (Schreibman et al., 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
        Influenced by the work of developmental psychologists, new EIBIs have
        placed more emphasis on child motivation. In these new approaches, the
        adult gives the child more control over the choice of materials and the
        initiative for interactions. Reinforcers are natural, that is, they are
        directly related to the success of the task. A wider range of responses
        is accepted and attempts, not only successes, are rewarded.
      </p>
      <p>
        As in the Lovaas program, these new approaches encompass the
        fundamentals of ABA methodology (such as DTT), take a comprehensive
        approach to skills development, and maintain a quite structured
        environment to facilitate initiative. A prominent example of EIBI
        inspired by these new approaches is the early start Denver model (ESDM).
      </p>

      <p>Currently, the critical components of EIBI involve the use of:</p>
      <ul class="list_ul">
        <li>a specific ABA-based teaching procedure (such as DTT)</li>
        <li>
          a very intensive format for an extended period of time (e.g., 15 hours
          per week for at least one year)
        </li>
        <li>a one-to-one adult to child ratio or in very small groups</li>
      </ul>

      <h4><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i> In the database</h4>
      <p>
        As it could be expected, the meta-analyses assessing the efficacy of
        EIBI included in this database focus on trials conducted among very
        young children with important cognitive difficulties. Despite
        differences in inclusion criteria across meta-analyses (e.g., some
        meta-analyses of EIBIs require that the duration of the intervention per
        week should exceed 10 hours per week, others 20 hours per week), all
        meta-analyses include clinical trials with a very long average duration
        (> 12 months) and with a very high average intensity (> 20 hours per
        week). In the database, the meta-analyses of EIBI included trials that
        srictly follow the Lovaas model as well as more naturalistic approaches
        (e.g., ESDM).
