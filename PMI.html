      <h2>Parent-mediated interventions (PMI)</h2>
      <h4><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i> History</h4>
      <p>
        Since the beginning of the development of interventions for children
        with ASDs, some authors have given parents a privileged position in the
        intervention process (e.g., Schopler, 1971). Parents-mediated
        interventions (PMI) propose to teach intervention techniques to parents
        so that they can apply these techniques with their child on a regular
        basis. The objective of involving parents is to implement a first
        interventions very early in the child's development and, because of the
        sharing of the daily environment, to improve the generalization of the
        skills learned by the child during the intervention.
      </p>
      <h4><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i> Description</h4>
      <p>
        The type of intervention that can be mediated by parents is very wide,
        ranging from application of massages to an early intensive behavioral
        intervention. Even within PMI that provide psychosocial interventions,
        some interventions propose to teach parents to implement
        social-communication interactions, others to use joint attention or to
        implement an applied behavioral analysis approach. The primary outcome
        intrinsecally targeted by these interventions can be quite variable,
        with interventions seeking to improve primarily problem behaviors,
        communication, or parent-child interactions (Oono et al., 2013)
      </p>

      <h4><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i> In the database</h4>
      <p>
        The meta-analyses included in this database reflect this heterogeneity
        in the approaches used by PMI. However, despite the diversity of
        approaches used by the clinical trials included in the meta-analyses of
        PMI, there are common points:
      </p>
      <ul class="list_ul">
        <li>The parents are always the primary implementers of the therapy</li>
        <li>
          The approach used by the parents is always a psychosocial approach
        </li>
        <li>Children who receive the PMI are mostly very young</li>
        <li>
          Naturalistic developmental behavioral interventions (NDBI) and
          developmental interventions (DEV) are the two most frequently
          approaches implanted by the parents
        </li>
      </ul>
